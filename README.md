# Arctic_Isotopes
This repository contains data and codes to perform theoretical prediction and reanalysis of Arctic C and N stable isotopes in soil profiles.

## Data
The data digitized from articles are in separate text files in the 'data/csv_litterature' folder. They are uniformized and bound together with 'codes/DepthProfile_DataManipulation.R'.

## Theoretical figures
Theoretical computations and figures are done within the 'codes/Factionation_theory.Rmd' Rmarkdown.

## Model Fit
R and stan codes used to fit statistical models are in 'codes/fit' folder. Results of model fits are in the 'results/fit' folder.

## Figures
Code to produce the figures from model results are in the 'code/plots' folder.
